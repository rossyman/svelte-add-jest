## ❓ What is this?

This is an **experimental** command to run to add Jest to your SvelteKit project.

## 🛠 Usage

You must start with a fresh copy of the official SvelteKit template, which is currently created by running this command:

```sh
npm init svelte@next
```

Once that is set up, run this command in your project directory to set up Jest:

```sh
npx svelte-add jest
```

After the preset runs,

- You can apply _another_ [Svelte Adder](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-adders) to your project for more functionality.
